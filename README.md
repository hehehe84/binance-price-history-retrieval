# Retrieval Price history Application using Binance API

In order to simplify the installation and manage the orchestration, I chose to use a docker-compose setup.

Setup:

Create a .env at the root of the folder and enter the following values:

MONGO_URI=mongodb://mongo:27017/nestdb
BINANCE_API_KEY= "Generated on https://testnet.binance.vision/"
BINANCE_API_SECRET="Also generated on https://testnet.binance.vision/"
